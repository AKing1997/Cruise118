                                    <p>Because the Galapagos Islands have very strict regulations regarding cruise ship
                                        operations in the archipelagos, Celebrity Cruises is one of the few cruise lines
                                        with permission to offer sailings in the islands. These regulations help protect
                                        wildlife and nature, which is important for the conservation efforts of the
                                        Galapagos Islands. Find out more about these individual ships at the links
