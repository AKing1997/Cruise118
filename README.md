# Cruise118 Website Redesign

This repository contains the redesign of the Cruise118 website, aiming to create a modern, responsive, and user-friendly interface. The redesign adheres to the style and feel of the Cruise118 family of websites while enhancing the user experience on various devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile).


## Features

### 1. Responsive Design
The redesign focuses on ensuring that the website is fully responsive across all devices, including desktop, tablet, and mobile, using Bootstrap for a consistent grid system and layout structure.

### 2. Page Templates
This project includes the creation of six key page templates:
- **Home Page**: A landing page that showcases promotions, popular cruises, and featured destinations.
- **Results Page**: A search results page for displaying available cruise deals.
- **Product Page**: A detailed view of a specific cruise, including itinerary, ship details, and pricing.
- **Operator Page**: Information about a specific cruise line, including available ships and destinations.
- **Ship Page**: Detailed information about a specific ship, including amenities and deck plans.
- **Destination Page**: Information about specific cruise destinations, including itineraries and ports of call.

### 3. Image and Icon Management
All images and icons are organized under the `Assets` directory. The carousel and country flags are stored in their respective folders for easy access and management.

### 4. JSON Data Management
The `Json` directory contains various JSON files that store data for awards, carousel promotions, categories, cruises, destinations, and more. These files are used to dynamically generate content across the website.

### 5. JavaScript Functionality
Custom JavaScript files are located in the `Js` directory, providing functionality for carousel promotions, filtering options, card generation, and more. Bootstrap's JS bundle is included to support interactive elements.

## Known Issues
- The **civ.html** and **Celebrity_Ascent.html** pages are incomplete due to time constraints. These pages require further development to match the required design and functionality.

## Future Enhancements
- Complete the design and development of the **civ.html** and **Celebrity_Ascent.html** pages.
- Improve accessibility across the site, ensuring compliance with WCAG guidelines.
- Optimize images and assets for faster loading times.
- Enhance SEO across all pages to improve search engine visibility.
